            <p class=aboutText> <img src="./assets/images/Apple_Picking.jpg" alt="My Picture" >Some people take a straight path to a career in development; I stopped for a few coffee breaks on the way. From working in kitchens to pay for college, to selling tickets for Major League Soccer matches, to managing a branch of a rental car company I've certainly had my share of varied career experience. But it was my passion to create something lasting, and a desire to be at the forefront of innovation that led me to the Case Western Coding Boot Camp, and the challenge of mastering the skills to be a developer.</p>
            <p class=aboutText>The drive to create is mostly fueled by passions. My personal projects will generally reflect those passions; Sports, storytelling, video games, immersive experiences and ways to generally make ourselves happier in our day to day lives. But another of passions is the taking on challenges, and the feeling of overcoming them. This is why this page exists, so you can see the success I've had, and present me with the challenges you have before you as a person, as a company, or beyond. So if you have a challenge ahead, and would like to contact me about working on it with you, then I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
